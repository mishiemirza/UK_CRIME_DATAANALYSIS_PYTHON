**📊 UK Crime Data Analysis Using Big Data Technologies**

Python | SQL | Power BI | Jupyter Notebook

**📝 Project Overview**

This project analyzes over ten years of UK crime data to uncover long-term trends, crime hotspots, and category-level patterns.
Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project transforms raw public crime datasets into meaningful, data-driven insights to support policy analysis, public safety planning, and strategic decision-making.

**🎯 Objective**

To analyze and visualize long-term crime trends across the UK using big data techniques, enabling deeper understanding of crime behavior and supporting data-informed policy decisions.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (if applicable)

SQL: Data cleaning, querying, and aggregations

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual analytics

Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration, analysis pipeline development

**🔄 Project Workflow**
1. Data Collection & Understanding

    -Gathered crime records spanning 10+ years from publicly available UK datasets.

    -Explored datasets to understand attributes like dates, regions, crime types, and outcomes.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation

   -Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

   -Standardized time formats for long-term trend analysis.

   -Normalized location fields for accurate hotspot mapping.

   Performed aggregations using Python and SQL for efficient querying.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   -Identified crime distribution across regions and years.

   -Analyzed trends by crime category (e.g., violent crime, theft, burglary).

   -Explored correlations between crime types and geographic areas.

4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Created interactive Power BI dashboards showing:

📍 Crime hotspots across UK regions

📈 Trends over time (seasonal, yearly, long-term)

🧩 Category-wise patterns and correlations

🔎 Filters for exploring crime by region, category, and year

5. Insight Generation

  -Identified patterns helpful for policy evaluation and safety planning.

  -Highlighted regions with increasing or decreasing crime rates.

  -Provided evidence-based analysis for long-term crime behavior.

**📈 Result / Impact**

  -This project delivers clear, actionable insights into UK crime trends.
It supports:

🔍 Data-driven decision-making

🛡️ Public safety assessments

📊 Strategic planning for law enforcement and policy makers

The analysis enables users to explore long-term patterns and understand how crime has evolved across the UK over the last decade.
